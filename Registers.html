<h1>Registers</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

	<p>
	The ESIM architecture maintains <b>12</b> registers each of size 1 word.
	<div>
	<dfn>
		<b>Word:&nbsp; </b> It is the  basic unit of memory. 
	</dfn>
	<div>
	Each register can hold either an integer or an address of a string.
	</p>

<h2>Register Set</h2>
	<p>
	There are 8 <em>General Purpose Registers</em>, R0--R7, which the user programs can use directly. These are followed by another 8 <em>Kernel Registers</em>, S0--S7 which are used only by the kernel. There are an additional 4 <em>Temporary Registers</em>, T0--T3 which are used by the compiler. There are also 4 additional special purpose registers BP, IP, SP and PID which are used as Base pointer, Instruction pointer, Stack pointer and Process Identifier respectively.
	The following table summarises the various registers and the sections where they are referred.
